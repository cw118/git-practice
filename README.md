# git-practice

A repo I'm using to train my Git and GitHub skills.

## Basic commands

Starting by familiarizing myself with basic Git commands and following some tutorials:

- `git clone`: clone a repository
- `git status`: show changes, as well as tracked and untracked files, in a directory
- `git add`: tell Git to track certain or all files in order to include them in a commit (using `git add .` will stage all files with Git, or in other words, cause all files to be tracked)
- `git commit`: commit (save) changes
  - First `-m`: sets commit message (required)
  - Second `-m`: sets commit description (optional)
